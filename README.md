# DumsorGame
A rudimentary power system management game, with embarassing coding style in Java 1.7

My first big coding project, don't judge too hard. I haven't touched it since 2016, maybe one day I fix it.

You have to build a power system in a town with originally no access to electricity, paying attention to keeping the supply sufficient.
In-game popup windows help explain the mechanics.

Contains a windows exe, to run from source the main class is src/DumsorBase/DumsorMain.java
